### From source

With Rust's package manager cargo, you can install lsd via:

```sh
cargo install lsd
```

If you want to install the latest master branch commit:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd.git --branch master
```

### From Binaries

The [release page](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd/releases) includes precompiled binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows for every release. You can also get the latest binary of `master` branch from the [GitHub action build artifacts](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+is%3Asuccess+event%3Apush) (choose the top action and scroll down to the artifacts section).

## Configuration

`lsd` can be configured with a configuration file to set the default options.
Check [Config file content](#config-file-content) for details.

### Config file location

### Non-Windows

On non-Windows systems `lsd` follows the
[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
convention for the location of the configuration file. A `config.yaml` or `config.yml` file will be searched for in these locations, in order:

- `$HOME/.config/lsd`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lsd`

On most systems these are mapped to the same location, which is `~/.config/lsd/config.yaml`.

### Windows

On Windows systems `lsd` searches for `config.yaml` or `config.yml` in the following locations, in order:

- `%USERPROFILE%\.config\lsd`
- `%APPDATA%\lsd`

These are usually something like `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\lsd\config.yaml` and `C:\Users\username\.config\lsd\config.yaml` respectively.

### Custom

You can also provide a configuration file from a non standard location:
`lsd --config-file [PATH]`

### Config file content

</details>

## Theme

`lsd` can be configured with theme files to set the colors or icons.

### Color Theme

Color theme can be configured in the [configuration file](#configuration)(color.theme),
The valid theme configurations are:

- `default`: the default color scheme shipped in `lsd`
- `custom`: use a custom color scheme defined in `colors.yaml`
- *(deprecated) theme_file_name(yaml): use the theme file to specify colors(without the `yaml` extension)*

When set to `custom`, `lsd` will look for `colors.yaml` in the
XDG Base Directory, e.g. ~/.config/lsd/colors.yaml

When configured with the `theme-file-name` which is a `yaml` file,
`lsd` will look up the theme file in the following way:

- relative name: check the XDG Base Directory, e.g. ~/.config/lsd/themes/<theme-file-name>.yaml
- absolute name: use the file path and name to find theme file

Check [Color Theme file content](#color-theme-file-content) for details.

#### Color Theme file content

Theme file use the [crossterm](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm)
to configure the colors, check [crossterm](https://docs.rs/crossterm/0.20.0/crossterm/style/enum.Color.html)
for supported colors.

Color table: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Xterm_256color_chart.svg

Please notice that color values would ignore the case, both lowercase and UPPERCASE is supported.

This is the default theme scheme shipped with `lsd`.

```yaml
user: 230
group: 187
permission:
  read: dark_green
  write: dark_yellow
  exec: dark_red
  exec-sticky: 5
  no-access: 245
  octal: 6
  acl: dark_cyan
  context: cyan
date:
  hour-old: 40
  day-old: 42
  older: 36
size:
  none: 245
  small: 229
  medium: 216
  large: 172
inode:
  valid: 13
  invalid: 245
links:
  valid: 13
  invalid: 245
tree-edge: 245
git-status:
  default: 245
  unmodified: 245
  ignored: 245
  new-in-index: dark_green
  new-in-workdir: dark_green
  typechange: dark_yellow
  deleted: dark_red
  renamed: dark_green
  modified: dark_yellow
  conflicted: dark_red
```

When creating a theme for `lsd`, you can specify any part of the default theme,
and then change its colors, the items missed would fallback to use the default colors.

Please also notice that an empty theme is **NOT** supported due to
[a bug in serde lib](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/issues/86).

### Icon Theme

Icon theme can be configured in a fixed location, `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/lsd/icons.yaml`,
for example, `~/.config/lsd/icons.yaml` on macOS,
please check [Config file location](#config-file-location) to make sure where is `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR`.

As the file name indicated, the icon theme file is a `yaml` file.

Check [Icon Theme file content](#icon-theme-file-content) for details.

#### Icon Theme file content

`lsd` support 3 kinds of icon overrides, by `name`, by `filetype` and by `extension`.
The final set of icons used will be a combination of what is shipped with in `lsd` with overrides from config applied on top of it.
*You can find the default set of icons [here](src/theme/icon.rs).*

Both nerd font glyphs and unicode emojis can be used for icons. You can find an example of icons customization below.

```yaml
name:
  .trash: 
  .cargo: 
  .emacs.d: 
  a.out: 
extension:
  go: 
  hs: 
  rs: 🦀
filetype:
  dir: 📂
  file: 📄
  pipe: 📩
  socket: 󰆨
  executable: 
  symlink-dir: 
  symlink-file: 
  device-char: 
  device-block: 󰜫
  special: 
```

## External Configurations

### Required

Enable nerd fonts for your terminal, URxvt for example in `.Xresources`:

```sh
URxvt*font:    xft:Hack Nerd Font:style=Regular:size=11
```

### Optional

In order to use lsd when entering the `ls` command, you need to add this to your shell
configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):

```sh
alias ls='lsd'
```

Some further examples of useful aliases:

```sh
alias l='ls -l'
alias la='ls -a'
alias lla='ls -la'
alias lt='ls --tree'
```

## F.A.Q

### Uses unknown compression for member 'control.tar.zst' when using deb

Zst compression is supported starting from `Debian 12` and `Ubuntu 21.10`,
Please use the `_xz.deb` released starting from `lsd v1.1.0`.

Please check https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd/issues/891 for details or manual fixes.

### Custom Color Schemes for Windows
For `lsd` currently, it reads a system environment variable called LS_COLORS. Please look at the marked solution in [this post](https://github.com/orgs/lsd-rs/discussions/958#discussioncomment-7659375), which contains a guide on how to set a color scheme.

### Icons not showing up

For `lsd` to be able to display icons, the font has to include special font glyphs. This might not be the case for most fonts that you download. Thankfully, you can patch most fonts using [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and add these icons. Or you can just download an already patched version of your favourite font from [NerdFont font download page](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
Here is a guide on how to setup fonts on [macOS](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd/issues/199#issuecomment-494218334) and [Android](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd/issues/423).

To check if the font you are using is setup correctly, try running the following snippet in a shell and see if that [prints a folder icon](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd/issues/510#issuecomment-860000306). If it prints a box, or question mark or something else, then you might have some issues in how you setup the font or how your terminal emulator renders the font.

```sh
echo $'\uf115'
```

### Icons missing or not rendering correctly using PuTTY/KiTTY on Windows

First of all, make sure a patched font is installed and PuTTY/KiTTY is configurated to use it, please check [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

There are problems for PuTTY/KiTTY to show 2 char wide icons, make sure using a 1 char wide font like [Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete Mono Windows Compatible](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/Hack/Regular/complete/Hack%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono%20Windows%20Compatible.ttf), check [this issue](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd/issues/331) for detail.

### Colors

You can customize filetype colors using `LS_COLORS` and other colors using the theme.

The default colors are:

| User/Group                                                            | Permission                                                                             | File Type (changes based on your terminal colorscheme)                                                  | Date                                                                                 | File Size                                                                   |

### First char of folder/file getting trimmed

Workaround for Konsole: ㅤEdit the config file (or [create it](#config-file-location) if it doesn't already exist) and paste the following into it (contains invisible unicode characters):

```yml
icons:
    separator: " ㅤ"
```

This is a known issue in a few terminal emulator. Try using a different terminal emulator like. [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) and [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) are really good alternatives. You might also want to check if your font is responsible for causing this.
To verify this, try running lsd with icons disabled and if it still does not have the first character, then this is an lsd bug:

```sh
lsd --icon never --ignore-config
```

### UTF-8 Chars

`lsd` will try to display the UTF-8 chars in file name, A `U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`(�) is used to represent the invalid UTF-8 chars.

### Icons are showing up strangely

Nerd Fonts is moving the codepoints of the Material Design Icons in 3.0, so lsd has updated the icons in #830. If your icons look weird, use fonts that have been patched using Nerd Fonts v2.3.0 or later.
