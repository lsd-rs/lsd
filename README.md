## Description

This project is heavily inspired by the super [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)
project but with some little differences.  For example it is written in rust and not in ruby which makes it much faster.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Install the patched fonts of powerline nerd-font and/or font-awesome. Have a look at the [Nerd Font README](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/readme.md) for more installation instructions. Don't forget to setup your terminal in order to use the correct font.

See [this issue comment](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/issues/199#issuecomment-494218334) for detailed instructions on how to configure iTerm2 font settings correctly.

```

### From Binaries

The [release page](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/releases) includes precompiled binaries for Linux and macOS.

## Configuration

`lsd` can be configured with a configuration file to set the default options.
Check [Config file content](#config-file-content) for details.

### Config file location

#### Non-Windows

On non-Windows systems `lsd` follows the
[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
convention for the location of the configuration file. The configuration dir
`lsd` uses is itself named `lsd`. In that directory it looks first for a file
called `config.yaml`.
For most people it should be enough to put their config file at
`~/.config/lsd/config.yaml`.

#### Windows

On Windows systems `lsd` only looks for the `config.yaml` files in one location:
`%APPDATA%\lsd\`

#### Custom

You can also provide a configuration file from a non standard location:
`lsd --config-file [PATH]`

### Config file content

This is an example config file with the default values and some additional
remarks.

```yaml
# == Classic ==
# This is a shorthand to override some of the options to be backwards compatible
# with `ls`. It affects the "color"->"when", "sorting"->"dir-grouping", "date"
# and "icons"->"when" options.
# Possible values: false, true
classic: false

# == Blocks ==
# This specifies the columns and their order when using the long and the tree
# layout.
# Possible values: permission, user, group, size, size_value, date, name, inode
blocks:
  - permission
  - user
  - group
  - size
  - date
  - name

# == Color ==
# This has various color options. (Will be expanded in the future.)
color:
  # When to colorize the output.
  # When "classic" is set, this is set to "never".
  # Possible values: never, auto, always
  when: auto
  # How to colorize the output.
  # When "classic" is set, this is set to "no-color".
  # Possible values: default, no-color, no-lscolors, <theme-file-name>
  # when specifying <theme-file-name>, lsd will look up theme file in
  # XDG Base Directory if relative
  # The file path if absolute
  theme: default

# == Date ==
# This specifies the date format for the date column. The freeform format
# accepts an strftime like string.
# When "classic" is set, this is set to "date".
# Possible values: date, relative, '+<date_format>' 
# `date_format` will be a `strftime` formatted value. e.g. `date: '+%d %b %y %X'` will give you a date like this: 17 Jun 21 20:14:55
date: date

# == Dereference ==
# Whether to dereference symbolic links.
# Possible values: false, true
dereference: false

# == Display ==
# What items to display. Do not specify this for the default behavior.
# Possible values: all, almost-all, directory-only
# display: all

# == Icons ==
icons:
  # When to use icons.
  # When "classic" is set, this is set to "never".
  # Possible values: always, auto, never
  when: auto
  # Which icon theme to use.
  # Possible values: fancy, unicode
  theme: fancy
  # Separator between icon and the name
  # Default to 1 space
  separator: ' '


# == Ignore Globs ==
# A list of globs to ignore when listing.
# ignore-globs:
#   - .git

# == Indicators ==
# Whether to add indicator characters to certain listed files.
# Possible values: false, true
indicators: false

# == Layout ==
# Which layout to use. "oneline" might be a bit confusing here and should be
# called "one-per-line". It might be changed in the future.
# Possible values: grid, tree, oneline
layout: grid

# == Recursion ==
recursion:
  # Whether to enable recursion.
  # Possible values: false, true
  enabled: false
  # How deep the recursion should go. This has to be a positive integer. Leave
  # it unspecified for (virtually) infinite.
  # depth: 3

# == Size ==
# Specifies the format of the size column.
# Possible values: default, short, bytes
size: default

# == Sorting ==
sorting:
  # Specify what to sort by.
  # Possible values: extension, name, time, size, version
  column: name
  # Whether to reverse the sorting.
  # Possible values: false, true
  reverse: false
  # Whether to group directories together and where.
  # When "classic" is set, this is set to "none".
  # Possible values: first, last, none
  dir-grouping: none

# == No Symlink ==
# Whether to omit showing symlink targets
# Possible values: false, true
no-symlink: false

# == Total size ==
# Whether to display the total size of directories.
# Possible values: false, true
total-size: false

# == Symlink arrow ==
# Specifies how the symlink arrow display, chars in both ascii and utf8
symlink-arrow: â‡’
```

## Theme

`lsd` can be configured with a theme file to set the colors.

Theme can be configured in the [configuration file](#configuration)(color.theme),
The valid theme configurations are:
- `default`: the default color scheme shipped in `lsd`
- `no-color`: classic mode, there will be just black and white.
- `no-lscolors`: do not check the `LSCOLORS` env
- theme-file-name(yaml): use the theme file to specify colors

when configured with the `theme-file-name` which is a `yaml` file,
`lsd` will look up the theme file in the following way:
- relative name: check the XDG Base Directory
- absolute name: use the file path and name to find theme file

Check [Theme file content](#theme-file-content) for details.

### Theme file content

Theme file use the [crossterm](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm)
configure the colors, check [crossterm](https://docs.rs/crossterm/0.20.0/crossterm/style/enum.Color.html)
for the supported colors.

Color table: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Xterm_256color_chart.svg

This is the default theme scheme shipped with `lsd`.

```yaml
user: 230
group: 187
permissions:
  read: Green
  write: Yellow
  exec: Red
  exec-sticky: 5
  no-access: 245
file-type:
  file:
    exec-uid: 40
    uid-no-exec: 184
    exec-no-uid: 40
    no-exec-no-uid: 184

    uid: 33
    no-uid: 33
  pipe: 44

  day-old: 42
  older: 36

  none: 245
  small: 229
  medium: 216
  large: 172
inode:
  valid: 13
  invalid: 245

  invalid: 245
tree-edge: 245
```


## External Configurations

### Required

Enable nerd fonts for your terminal, URxvt for example:

.Xresources

```
URxvt*font:    xft:Hack Nerd Font:style=Regular:size=11
```

### Optional

In order to use lsd when entering the `ls` command, you need to add this to your shell
configuration file  (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):

  ```sh
  alias ls='lsd'
  ```

Some further examples of useful aliases:

  ```sh
  alias l='ls -l'
  alias la='ls -a'
  alias lla='ls -la'
  alias lt='ls --tree'
  ```

## F.A.Q

### Default Colors

In the future the possibility to customize the colors might be implemented.
For now, the default colors are:

### UTF-8 Chars

`lsd` will try to display the UTF-8 chars in file name, A `U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`(ï¿½) is used to represent the invalid UTF-8 chars.
